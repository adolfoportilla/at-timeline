Improvements:


- Tooltip to see details of event.
- Mobil, it works but you can essentially keep scrolling for-EVER.
- Increase size of events on mobil?
- preProcessing algorithm. Right now it just does it based on the last element, but we can improve this drastically.



Questions?
- What happens if we have an outlier in the dataset.
- How to display when events are pretty scattered?
